<p><strong class="fw-700">Submitting Returns</strong></p>

<p>Non Business and Silver Tiered Business customers can generate a RMA number using our EZ Returns Program. Gold and Platinum Tiered Business Customers can email a list of their returns to their assigned account manager to receive a free return shipping label. 
Non Business and Silver Tiered Business customers are responsible for all return shipping postage. It is recommended that these customers insure, add tracking, and apply full postage on their return packages. We will not accept returns shipments with “Postage Due.” The customer accepts 100% responsibility of correctly packaging and ensuring that products being returned are not damaged during the shipment. Items damaged from return shipping are not covered under our warranty and return policy.

<p><strong class="fw-700">Shipping Fee Refunds</strong></p>

<p>Shipping fees paid by the customer are non-refundable, unless the following apply:</p>
<p>
  &#x25cf; Shipment carrier missed delivery date/time<br>
  &#x25cf; Products received with shipping damages<br>
  &#x25cf; Products were non-functional upon reception by customer. This is determined by PhonePartsUSA’s inspection team upon return reception. As the items must be free of damages.<br>
</p>


<p><strong class="fw-700">Shipping Damages</strong></p>

<p>
Customers are to report all shipping related damages <strong class="fw-700"><u>within 5 business days of the shipping carrier delivery date.</u></strong> All damaged items must be photographed and emailed to our support team; help@phonepartsusa.com or an assigned sales agent. If the damaged box contains openings or holes, customers are required to submit video surveillance of the unboxing. The product must be physically mailed back to our facility. Once received and inspected by our Returns Department, if the damages are found to be shipping related, appropriate shipping and purchase cost reimbursement will be issued via store credit or product replacement.
</p>


<p><strong class="fw-700">Return/Warranty Policy Abuse</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, some customers abuse our generous return, warranty, and other policies. Accordingly, we will be forced to apply stricter policies to those abusive customers.</p>


<p>PhonePartsUSA.com, LLC reserves the right to change all policies without any notice at any time.</p>
